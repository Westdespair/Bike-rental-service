# Bike-rental-service
A website for a fictional bike rental service, Keep Rolling Rolling Rolling. Made as a project in our web application and web technology courses. 

## Design Guidelines:
* Rounded edges, images, buttons
* Rounded sans-serif fonts. Roboto? Ubuntu?
* Vibrant, healthy colours
* Shadows under selected elements
* Never too many images of hip people on bikes
